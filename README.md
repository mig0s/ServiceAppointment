# Service Appointment System

The system was developed as an assignment for Active Server Pages .NET module of my Higher Diploma. Microsoft Access was used as a database for this project. The information below is courtesy of TMC Academy, Singapore, and it is a detailed description of the system and functions implemented.

### Background
(copyright TMC Academy – School of IT, Digital Media & Mass Comm, May 2015):

> Currently, the customer services are handled with appointments and are already available in the system.
> Hence, the CEO of Singa Aircon Limited has decided to deploy an online appointment system where
> customers can check the availability of the technicians and book appointment with the specific
> technicians.
>
> In order to book an appointment, a Customer needs to register as a member from the Singa Aircon’s
> website. Being a member, the customer can see the latest news about the services and related
> promotions on Air-conditioning appliances. The customers can book an appointment date and time with
> the technicians online. They could cancel the appointment and book a new appointment if they want to
> reschedule the appointment.
>
> The front office staff would have access to the overall systems and could generate reports and would
> indicate the venue once an appointment is confirmed. The technician would then be able to view the
> booked appointments.
>
> The CEO wishes to include this online appointment system on the Singa Aircon’s website. The CEO also
> expects the online website to have a neat and pleasant overall layout appearance where it can generate
> interest for both customers and technicians when they browse through its contents.
> Hence, each type of user will have the relevant rights to access the various areas of the web
> application.
>
> The website should include these few key areas as to achieve a good web design structure:
> - Navigation bars/site maps/ web user controls
> - Multimedia content – Animation, Splash screens or other similar contents
> - Textual content – Colour scheme, fonts, background, layouts, tables, grids
> - Page Organisation – Master pages, Nested master pages
> - Validation tools to be used appropriately.
> - Deploy features that would maintain the security aspects of the application.
>
> Also, the website application should have a database to store and access data. The database could be a
> Microsoft Access database or any database of your choice.
> As a web developer, you are required to accomplish these tasks for Singa Aircon Limited.
