# Service Appointment System

The system was developed as an assignment for Active Server Pages .NET module of my Higher Diploma. Microsoft Access was used as a database for this project. The information below is courtesy of TMC Academy, Singapore, and it is a detailed description of the system and functions implemented.

### Background
(copyright TMC Academy – School of IT, Digital Media & Mass Comm, May 2015):

> Currently, the customer services are handled with appointments and are already available in the system.
> Hence, the CEO of Singa Aircon Limited has decided to deploy an online appointment system where
> customers can check the availability of the technicians and book appointment with the specific
> technicians.
>
> In order to book an appointment, a Customer needs to register as a member from the Singa Aircon’s
> website. Being a member, the customer can see the latest news about the services and related
> promotions on Air-conditioning appliances. The customers can book an appointment date and time with
> the technicians online. They could cancel the appointment and book a new appointment if they want to
> reschedule the appointment.
>
> The front office staff would have access to the overall systems and could generate reports and would
> indicate the venue once an appointment is confirmed. The technician would then be able to view the
> booked appointments.
>
> The CEO wishes to include this online appointment system on the Singa Aircon’s website. The CEO also
> expects the online website to have a neat and pleasant overall layout appearance where it can generate
> interest for both customers and technicians when they browse through its contents.
> Hence, each type of user will have the relevant rights to access the various areas of the web
> application.
>
> The website should include these few key areas as to achieve a good web design structure:
> - Navigation bars/site maps/ web user controls
> - Multimedia content – Animation, Splash screens or other similar contents
> - Textual content – Colour scheme, fonts, background, layouts, tables, grids
> - Page Organisation – Master pages, Nested master pages
> - Validation tools to be used appropriately.
> - Deploy features that would maintain the security aspects of the application.
>
> Also, the website application should have a database to store and access data. The database could be a
> Microsoft Access database or any database of your choice.
> As a web developer, you are required to accomplish these tasks for Singa Aircon Limited.

### Member’s Login Registration
(copyright TMC Academy – School of IT, Digital Media & Mass Comm, May 2015):

The public user must register a login account as a member before they can do the appointment booking
to service their appliance or view other related appliance information. Once they have logged in as a
member, they can have the choice to change their login password.

### Login Authentication

Different types of user can be assigned to the relevant web pages. For example, a login member would
be able to perform online booking appointment.
You are expected to use login controls with proper configuration in terms of security permission for users
(role-based authentication) for the development of this task.

### Booking appointment
(copyright TMC Academy – School of IT, Digital Media & Mass Comm, May 2015):

Customers who are members can book appointments to service their appliances with specific technicians
at least three days in advance. The members can select the appropriate time and date. Once the booking
is done, the status of the appointment will be pending for confirmation from the system. The members will
be advised to check on the next day for confirmation. This information will be displayed as per the
booking. If a member needs to change the appointment after the confirmation, they need to cancel the
booked appointment.

### Confirm appointments
(copyright TMC Academy – School of IT, Digital Media & Mass Comm, May 2015):

A notification will be sent by the system to confirm by the technician when there is an appointment made
by a customer. Once the front-office staff assigns the appointment to the technician, the system will then
update the status of appointment and indicate the date, time and venue. Otherwise, Singa Aircon Limited,
would contact the customer personally to reschedule the appointment and update the system
accordingly. The technician can also view all their booked appointments.

### Report Generation
(copyright TMC Academy – School of IT, Digital Media & Mass Comm, May 2015):

The front office staff can generate a list of daily booked appointments for each month.
